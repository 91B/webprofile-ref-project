The book is availible here: https://gumroad.com/l/a-guide-to-opensaml
The new edition based on OpenSAML V3 is availible here: https://gumroad.com/l/a-guide-to-opensaml-v3

The sole purpose of the sample project is to illustrate the function of OpenSAML. 
Although, it can be a very good place to start when experimenting with OpenSAML, it should not be used for production purposes.
